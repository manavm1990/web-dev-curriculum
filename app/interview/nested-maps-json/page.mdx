# Nested Maps and JSON! üòï

<Lead>
  ‚ö†Ô∏è This example is a bit more advanced and may not be appropriate for this class...but, we're
  going to push the ‚úâÔ∏è, as they say!
</Lead>

Consider this updated Monsters database:

```js
const monsters = [
  {
    name: 'Cacodemon',
    health: 400,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Plasma Ball', damage: { min: 10, max: 60 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Baron of Hell',
    health: 1000,
    attacks: [
      { type: 'Claw', damage: { min: 15, max: 75 } },
      { type: 'Fireball', damage: { min: 15, max: 75 } },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'Cyberdemon',
    health: 4000,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Rocket', damage: { min: 20, max: 200 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Hell Knight',
    health: 800,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Claw', damage: { min: 15, max: 75 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Imp',
    health: 200,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Demon Fire', damage: { min: 10, max: 100 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Lost Soul',
    health: 100,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Charge', damage: { min: 5, max: 25 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Pinky',
    health: 300,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Rend', damage: { min: 5, max: 50 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Revenant',
    health: 500,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Rocket Barrage', damage: { min: 10, max: 100 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Spectre',
    health: 200,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Enraged Lunge', damage: { min: 5, max: 50 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Spider Mastermind',
    health: 2000,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Chaingun', damage: { min: 10, max: 100 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Arch Vile',
    health: 1000,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Inferno', damage: { min: 25, max: 100 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Zombieman',
    health: 200,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Shotgun', damage: { min: 5, max: 50 } }],
  },
]
```

<Small>The data above is not necessarily canonical to Doom</Small>

Now, we want to iterate over this data and add 10 to the max attack damage for each monster üòÖ.

## Think Like a Developer

Again, forget about code. Forget about computers. All we have is pencil and paper. How do we do this?

1. Start at the first monster. It's the Cacodemon.
1. Find the list of attacks for the Cacodemon. It's `[{ type: 'Plasma Ball', damage: { min: 10, max: 60 } }]`.
1. Identify the max damage. It's 60. Add 10 to it. Now it's 70.
1. Update it and proceed to the next monster.
1. Repeat until all monsters are done.

Now, let's shift back to thinking in code, as a functional programmer. We know that we are dealing with iteration, so think Array methods. We're not working with a true/false test here, so it's not `filter` or `find` or `some`. We are working with a transformation, so it's `map`.

But, something's different here. We have a list or array inside of another array...ü§î. An iteration inside of an interation....A `map` inside of a `map`!

## Assignment - 10 points

Reflect! What do you think ü§î‚ùî Too crazy? Make sense? What parts actually made sense to you and what parts were just too much?

Now...we have the same issue in the results.

```shell
node src/index.js
[
  {
    "name": "Cacodemon",
    "health": 400,
    "attacks": [
      {
        "type": "Plasma Ball",
        "damage": {
          "min": 10,
          "max": 70
        }
      }
    ]
  },
```

How can we avoid this mutation? Work with AI ü§ñ to gain a better understanding and figure out how to avoid the mutation. **HINT:** We don't want to keep doing `...` ad infinitum! **ANOTHER HINT:** One possible solution is kind of revealed in the video...

Update your reflection to discuss the solution. Or, you may create a video.

# Solution

## Review and Nested Spreads

First, we review the problem. We have a list of monsters. Each monster has a list of attacks. Each attack has a damage object with min and max values. We want to add 10 to the max value for each attack. We want to avoid mutating the original data.

We discover the the **spread operator** is not going to help us if there is nested data. Unfortunately, since each nested object is its own reference (unlike primitives, which are just copied as is), it will take a lot of ongoing spreading to copy the data üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

```js
const monsters = [
  {
    name: 'Cacodemon',
    health: 400,
    attacks: [{ type: 'Plasma Ball', damage: { min: 10, max: 60 } }],
  },
  {
    name: 'Baron of Hell',
    health: 1000,
    attacks: [
      { type: 'Claw', damage: { min: 15, max: 75 } },
      { type: 'Fireball', damage: { min: 15, max: 75 } },
    ],
  },
]

const updatedMonsters = monsters.map((monster) => ({
  ...monster,
  attacks: monster.attacks.map((attack) => ({
    ...attack,
    damage: {
      ...attack.damage,
      max: attack.damage.max + 10,
    },
  })),
}))
```

## stringify to break the reference!

If we take any JS objects, we can convert them to a string using `JSON.stringify`. This will break the reference. We can then convert it back to an object using `JSON.parse`.

## Structured Clones

Even better, and the most modern solution is to use `structuredClone`.
