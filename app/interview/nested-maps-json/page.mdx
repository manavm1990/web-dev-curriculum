## Assignment - 10 points

Reflect! What do you think ü§î‚ùî Too crazy? Make sense? What parts actually made sense to you and what parts were just too much?

Now...we have the same issue in the results.

```shell
node src/index.js
[
  {
    "name": "Cacodemon",
    "health": 400,
    "attacks": [
      {
        "type": "Plasma Ball",
        "damage": {
          "min": 10,
          "max": 70
        }
      }
    ]
  },
```

How can we avoid this mutation? Work with AI ü§ñ to gain a better understanding and figure out how to avoid the mutation. **HINT:** We don't want to keep doing `...` ad infinitum! **ANOTHER HINT:** One possible solution is kind of revealed in the video...

Update your reflection to discuss the solution. Or, you may create a video.
