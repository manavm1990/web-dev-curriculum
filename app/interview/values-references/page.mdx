# Pass by Copy/Value vs Pass by Reference

## Assignment - 10 points

Go back to your Node JS Template from a few weeks ago. Create a new file called, `'values-and-references.js'` in the `src` folder.

Recreate the code and results that you see in the following video. It doesn't have to be exact, but the point is the same.

To summarize what the video tells you to do:

1. Resolve the issue in the code to avoid the data mutation.
1. Create an MD Gist explaining the issue and your solution. Also, mention why we might want to avoid mutation in the first place.
1. Create a 'teach back video' about what you learned. Walk me through your research. Did you use AI (probably!)? If so, how did you leverage it to learn the concepts? Your video should not just be you reading your reflection to me. Instead, it should include practical examples and demonstrate your understanding of the concepts discussed. Include your face in the video too, as in an asynchronous interview. This is a great opportunity to practice your presentation skills and show me what you know. The video should be 5-8 minutes long.

Note that you don't need to add and commit your code, unless you want to. I'm interested in your reflection and your video and how well you demonstrate your understanding of the concepts discussed.
