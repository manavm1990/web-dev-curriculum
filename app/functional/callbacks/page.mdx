  For the next few lessons, we are using [this updated template repo that you must access via GitHub
  Classroom.](https://classroom.github.com/a/G0AOkrIv). This is the repo that you will use to follow
  along in the videos and it's also the repo that you will use to submit your assignments.
</Lead>

- Upon clicking the above link, it should automatically fork the repo to your GitHub account for you. From there, you will clone the repo as before.
- As always...as always...**DO NOT** clone this repo into another repo on your computer. Make sure that you are in your `Dev` directory or similar on your computer.
- If you have any issues with the above link, please let me know ASAP.

Make sure that you are cloning **your** repo and not the one that belongs to the classroom. The clone command that you copy from GitHub should look something like this: `gh repo clone swic-web-development/functional-js-<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>`.

# First-Class Functions and Callbacks in JavaScript

<Large>
  Everything in JS is an object, except primitives, and even those behave like objects sometimes.
</Large>

This means that even functions are objects! This is a powerful concept that allows us to pass functions as arguments to other functions, store them in variables, and return them from other functions. In this lesson, we'll explore how this concept enables **first-class functions** and **callbacks** in JavaScript.

## Functions Are First-Class Citizens

JS hereby declares that **Functions are first-class citizens.** JS hereby bestows upon them all of the rights and privileges afforded to all other data types in JS, including objects. Unlike what happens in other languages, we shall not discriminate against functions. They shall be treated as equals.

### Storing Functions in Variables

We can store numbers in variables, right? `const x = 3;`. We can store strings in variables, right? `const y = 'Hello';`. We can store objects in variables, right? `const z = { name: 'John' };`. Well, guess what? We can store functions in variables too!

```javascript
const greet = function () {
  return 'Hello, world!'
}
```

Now, just because we can do something doesn't meant that we should, and the above code is üÜó, but not typical. Instead, we usually only write our functions this way when we use a special syntax known as **arrow functions.**

### Using Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are especially useful when passing functions as arguments to other functions, which we'll see shortly.

```javascript
const greet = () => {
  return 'Hello, world!'
}
```

This is the same as the previous example, but with a more compact syntax. In fact, we can make it even more concise in a case like above where there is only a single statement in the function body: `const greet = () => 'Hello, world!'`.

We will typically only do this if:

- There is only a single statement in the function body.
- The single statement is a return statement.

#### Confused üòï‚ùî

If you don't like that succinct arrow function, no worries. You are free to write out your functions as full declarations as we have been doing. However, you are sure to see arrow functions in the wild, so it's good to know what they are.

The above video shows the progression of functions from full declarations to arrow functions.

```javascript
function calculateOrderCost(order) {
  return order.quantity * order.priceEa
}

const calcOrderCost = (order) => {
  return order.quantity * order.priceEa
}
```

`const calcOrderCost = (order) => order.quantity * order.priceEa`

## Callback Functions

<Lead>JS hereby declares that **Functions are first-class citizens...**</Lead>

We can pass strings into as function arguments, right?

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(greet('John'))
```

We can pass numbers into as function arguments, right?

```javascript
function double(num) {
  return num * 2
}

console.log(double(3))
```

Well, guess what? We can pass functions into as function arguments too!

```javascript
function doSomethingWithNumber(number, callbackFunction) {
  return callbackFunction(number)
}

function divideByTwo(num) {
  return num / 2
}

function double(num) {
  return num * 2
}

function triple(num) {
  return num * 3
}

doSomethingWithNumber(42, double)
doSomethingWithNumber(42, triple)
doSomethingWithNumber(42, divideByTwo)
```

A callback function is a function that gets passed to another function and is executed later. This is a powerful concept that enables a wide range of functionality in JavaScript. This pattern might seem unusual at first, but it's the foundation of modern JavaScript's approach to array processing.

We are skipping `forEach` and headed straight into `map`. `forEach` doesn't have any major intrinsic value or advantage as compared to `map`. `map` is more powerful and more flexible, and works in all the same ways as `forEach`.

---

## Introduction to the `map` Method

The `map` works specifically on arrays. It leverages a callback function to transform each element of the array into a new element. The original array remains unchanged.

Let's start with a simple example where we want to double each number in an array.

First, think through the steps:

1. Start with an array of numbers.
2. For each number in the array:

- Multiply the number by 2.

3. Create a new array with the doubled numbers.

Now, with an imperative loop:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubledNumbers = []

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  doubledNumbers.push(numbers[i] * 2)
}

console.log(doubledNumbers)
```

And now, with the `map` method:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return number * 2
})

console.log(doubledNumbers)
```

The below video uses the [same example as MDN does.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)

## `map` Method Mechanics

A few things to note about the `map` method:

- The `map` method automatically iterates over each element in the array. There is no need to specify an index or length.
- The `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
- The `map` method does not change the original array. It returns a new array with the transformed elements.
- We must be sure to return something from the callback function. If we don't, the new array will be filled with `undefined`, as a function that doesn't return anything returns `undefined` by default.

## JS With a Dash of HTML

The most common task for any UI is to take some data, usually an array of object literals and to render that data to the screen. This is usually done by using `map`. We take each piece of data and transform it into a string of HTML that we can then render in the browser.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(function (number) {
  return `<li>${number * 2}</li>`
})

// Join the array back into a string with a newline between each item
console.log(doubledNumbers.join('\n'))
```

Again, for comparison, here's the same with an imperative loop:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const doubledNumbers = []

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  doubledNumbers.push(`<li>${numbers[i] * 2}</li>`)
}

console.log(doubledNumbers.join('\n'))
```

## Assignment

### Demonstrate the Demos - 10 points

You should have the new **classroom template repo** cloned and ready to go. So, work through this whole lesson from top to bottom. As you finish each section, make sure to add and commit your changes.

Meanwhile, have a GitHub Gist open. As you work through each part of the lesson, write a brief summary of what you learned in that section. This will be your reflection assignment. Use proper headings and bullet points to organize your thoughts.

### Explore Array Callback Methods - 10 points

Now that you have a good understanding of the `map` method, explore the other array callback methods on MDN by picking one of theses methods:

- `filter`
- `reduce` - ‚ö†Ô∏è this one is a bit more advanced!
- `find`
- `some`
- `every`
- `sort`

Now, create a new file in your classroom repo called `array-callback-methods.md`. Create a demo of the method you chose and then create a 'teach back video.' In this video, you should explain the method you chose and how it works. You should also explain how it is similar to and different from the `map` method.

Your video should be 3-5 minutes long.

### Deliverables

- A reflection assignment in a GitHub Gist.
- Your classroom repo should have commits for each section of the lesson.
- A new file in your classroom repo called `array-callback-methods.md` with a demo.
- A 'teach back video' explaining the method you chose and how it works.

To get full credit, you must have well-formatted markdown files and a video that is clear and easy to understand. Your repo should have clear, well-written commit messages.
