# CSS 💄 Review

## Introduction

🆗. You can probably anticipate what this assignment is about. In the last assignment, you rendered some HTML via **function components.** As a review, whenever we use the term, **function components,** we are referring to functions that serve as components, meaning that they return HTML. Now, it's time to add in some CSS 💄.

Recall that CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. And, since we are using Vite to bundle our code, we can simply add a CSS file to our project and import it into our JavaScript. Note that without a bundler such as Vite, it would not be this simple to render CSS 💄 with our HTML.

## How to Add CSS 💄❔

Well, if you followed along with the Vite starter code in a previous assigment you already know. In case you forgot, [here it is.](https://github.com/swic-web-development/browser-template/blob/32d3ad4d39d6e52443db0e88711bc850fbb6087e/src/main.js#L1) Just create your CSS 💄 file, and simply `import`.
