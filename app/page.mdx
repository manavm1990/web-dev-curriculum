# Welcome to SWIC CIS 177

<Large>
  Welcome to your first step towards becoming a professional web developer! In this course, you'll
  build on your HTML/CSS skills and learn to create dynamic web applications using JavaScript.
</Large>

This course aims to mimic real-world web development as closely as possible. Rather than tinkering with contrived code examples and outdated information from some textbook, you will be working with some of the latest tools and technologies that are used by professional web developers today.

## Developer Experience

To paraphrase [world-renowned programming instructor Todd McLeod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamcleod/), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the Holy Trinity of Web Development. A big part of applying these technologies is using tools that make your life easier as a developer. This course will introduce you to some of these tools, such as:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/). Sign up using your SWIC student email to get access to GitHub Pro and Copilot Pro for free. For more information, see [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We'll use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage our project dependencies.
- [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows or [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) for MacOS. These are command-line interfaces (CLI) that let you run commands on your computer.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). These tools help you write clean and consistent code.

**Note:** **Do not** install any of these tools yet, especially if you are on Mac. We will install these in a particular way to ensure that they work well together.

### AI ðŸ¤–

You've probably heard a lot about AI in web development. In this course, you'll learn how to use AI to help you write better code. Specifically, you'll use [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to write code faster and with fewer errors. You'll also use [Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet).

Remember, AI is not a replacement for learning how to code. It's a tool to help you write code faster and with fewer errors. You still need to understand the code you're writing. Blindly copying and pasting code is not a good idea.
