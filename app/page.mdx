# Welcome to SWIC CIS 177

<Large>
  Welcome to your first step towards becoming a professional web developer! In this course, you'll
  build on your HTML/CSS skills and learn to create dynamic web applications using JavaScript.
</Large>

This course aims to mimic real-world web development as closely as possible. Rather than tinkering with contrived code examples and outdated information from some textbook, you will be working with some of the latest tools and technologies that are used by professional web developers today.

## Developer Experience

To paraphrase [world-renowned programming instructor Todd McLeod](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamcleod/), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the Holy Trinity of Web Development. A big part of applying these technologies is using tools that make your life easier as a developer. This course will introduce you to some of these tools, such as:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/). Sign up using your SWIC student email to get access to GitHub Pro and Copilot Pro for free. For more information, see [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). We'll use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage our project dependencies.
- [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for Windows or [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) for MacOS. These are command-line interfaces (CLI) that let you run commands on your computer.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). These tools help you write clean and consistent code.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). A modern build tool that significantly speeds up your development process. Namely, we will be using a local development server to simulate how our web apps will actual work on a real live server.

**Note:** **Do not** install any of these tools yet, especially if you are on Mac. We will install these in a particular way to ensure that they work well together.

### AI ü§ñ

You've probably heard a lot about AI in web development. In this course, you'll learn how to use AI to help you write better code. Specifically, you'll use [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) to write code faster and with fewer errors. You'll also use [Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet).

Remember, AI is not a replacement for learning how to code. It's a tool to help you write code faster and with fewer errors. You still need to understand the code you're writing. Blindly copying and pasting code is not a good idea.

## About the Curriculum

Again, this Curriculum is designed to mimic real-world web development as closely as possible. You will be working on projects that are similar, but simplified versions of what one might encounter in a professional setting. You will also be using tools and technologies that are used by professional web developers today.

You're expected to know basic HTML and CSS, but we will certainly build on these skills, making sure that you are writing semantic HTML as possible. We will also introduce you to some advanced CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid. But the biggest leap you will make with CSS is leveraging [Tailwind CSS.](https://tailwindcss.com/)

We will also make mention of responsive CSS, but as our focus will be JavaScript, we will not spend too much time on this. You are expected to know how to make a website responsive using [media queries.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries)

Along the way, as mentioned, we will be gaining Experience working with command line basics, Git, and GitHub. We will also be using Node.js and npm to manage our project dependencies. We will be using ESLint and Prettier to help us write clean and consistent code.

### RE: JavaScript

JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It is the language of the web. There is no feasible way to truly cover and learn all of JS. Instead, this course will focus on the basics of JavaScript that most directly apply to the most popular frontend library, React. You may have even heard about it.

Note that learning JavaScript fundamentals is the most important thing and we will not be actually using React. For one thing, your career path may or may not involve React. However, with a solid understanding of JavaScript, whether you work with React, Angular, Vue, or even legacy jQuery, you will be able to adapt and learn new technologies as they come along. In other words, learn the fundamentals of a language first, not the framework. Frameworks come and go, but the language remains.

This curriculum is inspired by [the MDN curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/) and borrows excerpts from it. You will also find links to other resources and YouTube videos in this curriculum. Perhaps the glue that binds it all together is my 5+ years of learning, teaching and working with web development.
