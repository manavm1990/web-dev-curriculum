# Modern String Manipulation in JavaScript

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- Create and manipulate strings using both traditional quotes and template literals
- Understand when to use different string formatting approaches
- Implement proper Git commit practices with clear, descriptive messages
- Create professional-quality string formatting solutions

## Understanding Traditional Strings

JavaScript has traditionally used single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to create strings. Both methods work identically:

```javascript
const playerName = 'DoomGuy'
const weapon = 'Super Shotgun'
```

Professional developers typically standardize on double quotes for consistency. This makes code more readable and helps prevent errors when working with apostrophes and other special characters.

## Introducing Template Literals

Modern JavaScript introduces template literals, which use backticks (`) instead of quotes. The backtick key is typically located in the upper left of your keyboard, under the Esc key. Template literals offer significant advantages when working with complex text:

```javascript
// Traditional string concatenation
const name = 'DoomGuy'
const health = 100
const status = name + ' has ' + health + ' health remaining.'

// Modern template literal
const betterStatus = `${name} has ${health} health remaining.`
```

The `${}` syntax in template literals allows us to embed expressions directly in our text, making our code more readable and maintainable.

Recall that to actually see an output in the terminal, you would need to add `console.log()` statements. For instance, `console.log(betterStatus)` would output `DoomGuy has 100 health remaining.` (or similar) to the terminal.

Then, you would need to run the code with Node: `node` followed by the filename.

## Assignment - 15 Points Total

You will continue to work in the `js-node-template` repository you cloned in the previous lesson. So, make sure that you have navigated to this directory on your computer before proceeding.

Again, we are trying out Biome, and sometimes it doesn't start up correctly. You just need to exit out and try again with `code .`.

From the previous assignment, you have some code in `src/index.js`. As that was just demo code, you have 2️⃣ choices:

1. **Delete the existing code.**
1. Commit that code. To do that, from your terminal, would do: `git add src/index.js` and `git commit -m "Add demo code"`. The commit message isn't great here, but it is just demo code...

### String Manipulation (15 points)

Create a new JavaScript file in the `src` directory named `strings.js`. You can do this from your terminal with: `touch src/strings.js`.

that demonstrates your understanding of string formatting. Implement the following:

Create three variables containing your:

- Full name
- Current course name
- Expected grade (as a number)

Create two message formats:

- Using traditional string concatenation with quotes
- Using template literals with backticks

Each message should read: "[Your Name] is taking [Course Name] and expects to earn [Grade]%"

Verify that your code works by adding some `console.log` statements to print both messages to the console. Then, run your code with `node src/strings.js`. Take a screenshot of the output and include it in your submission.

Add your code to the staging area with: `git add src/strings.js`. Commit your code with a clear, descriptive message. For example: `git commit -m "Add string formatting code"`. Again, these aren't great commit messages, but there's not much to say when we are just practicing string formatting...

Push your code to GitHub with: `git push origin main`.

### Submission Requirements

Submit to Brightspace:
