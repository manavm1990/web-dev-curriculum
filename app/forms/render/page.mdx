## Assignment

Well, most of the assignment is covered by the code shown. The instructions are mentioned in the video. You should also change the form up a bit to make it your own. Make the form something different than the one shown in the video.

Commit early, commit often. I show some commits in the video, but you need more than those. Especially after you code up the form and then start changing it up to make it your own.

So, this means that when you are done, in addition to the component that you need to make as mentioned in the video, you need then make this something different than a contact form. You might consider creating a feedback form, a survey, or any other type of interactive form that suits you.

In addition, after watching each video, write a few sentences to reflect on what you learned from each video. This would be a GitHub Gist with just a few specifics about each video basically 'proving' that you watched the video.
