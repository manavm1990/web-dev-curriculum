# Function Components I

## Function Components

Function components are a foundational concept for modern JS libraries and frameworks, such as React. From a high level, their job is to receive data in the form of **props** (function parameters) and to return something that can be rendered by a browser.

In addition, these components maintain and manage **state**, and usually have children.

### Example

```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  return `<p>Hello, ${props.name}!</p>`
}
```

See what's happening here? We're defining a function called `Greeting` that takes in `props` as an argument. Inside the function, we're returning a string of HTML that includes the name passed in through `props`. This is a simple example of a function component.

Note the naming convention. For function components, which are intended to return HTML, we use **PascalCase**. This is a common convention in the React community and helps differentiate components from regular JavaScript functions.

Now, note that besides the new naming convention, there is nothing new here in terms of JavaScript concepts!

### Props

Props are short for "properties" and are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They are similar to function parameters in JavaScript. In the example above, `props` is an object that contains the properties passed to the `Greeting` component.

## Component Composition

Component composition is the process of combining multiple components to create a more complex UI. This is a powerful feature of function components, as it allows you to build reusable and modular components.

```javascript
function App() {
  return `<div>
      <Greeting name="Student" />
      <Message text="Welcome to web development!" />
    </div>`
}
```

So, what's this? We have an `App` component that returns a `div` containing two child components: `Greeting` and `Message`. This is an example of component composition, where we are combining multiple components to create a more complex UI.

Again...nothing new here!

## Component-Based Personal Website Assignment

### Overview

In this assignment, you will create a simple one-page personal website using function components. You'll demonstrate your HTML knowledge while applying the component-based approach we've discussed in class.

### Requirements

#### Basic Structure (10 points)

1. Create the following function components (2 points each):
   - `Header` - Contains your name and a brief title/tagline
   - `About` - Information about yourself
   - `Skills` - List of your skills or interests
   - `Content` - Main content section (see creative options below)
   - `Footer` - Copyright information and year

#### HTML Proficiency (15 points)

Demonstrate your HTML knowledge by including at least 10 different HTML elements across your components:

1. Headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) (1 point)
2. Paragraphs (`p`) (1 point)
3. Lists (`ul`/`ol` and `li`) (2 points)
4. Images (`img`) with alt attributes (2 points)
5. Semantic sectioning elements (`section`, `article`, etc.) (2 points)
6. Emphasis/text formatting (`em`, `strong`, etc.) (1 point)
7. Horizontal rule (`hr`) (1 point)
8. Links (`a`) to external resources (2 points)
9. A table (`table`, `tr`, `td`) to display information (2 points)
10. A simple form element for contact info (does not need to function) (1 point)

#### Component Implementation (5 points)

1. Proper props usage (2 points)
2. Correct component composition (1 point)
3. Proper rendering to DOM (1 point)
4. Following PascalCase naming convention (1 point)

#### Git Version Control (5 points)

1. Proper repository setup (1 point)
2. Minimum of 5 meaningful commits with descriptive messages (3 points)
3. Clear commit history showing incremental development (1 point)

### Creative Content Options

Make this website truly your own! Instead of just copying the example, choose content that reflects your personal interests. Some ideas include:

- A collection of your favorite recipes
- Profiles of your pets or dream pets
- A showcase of your favorite video games, books, or movies
- A hobby or collection you're passionate about
- Travel destinations you've visited or want to visit
- Sports, teams, or athletes you follow
- A collection of your favorite music albums

Note that, we are going HTML only. No, CSS ðŸ’„ (yet!)

### Example Component Structure

```javascript
// Your personal data to pass to components
const personalInfo = {
  name: 'Your Name',
  title: 'Web Developer & Game Enthusiast',
  about: 'A brief description about yourself...',
  skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'Component Thinking'],
  games: [
    {
      title: 'Game Title 1',
      genre: 'RPG',
      imageUrl: 'images/game1.jpg',
      description: 'Why I love this game...',
    },
    {
      title: 'Game Title 2',
      genre: 'Strategy',
      imageUrl: 'images/game2.jpg',
      description: 'What makes this game special...',
    },
  ],
  year: 2025,
}

// Main App component
function App() {
  // Render the complete page by composing components
  return `
    <div id="personal-website">
      ${Header({ name: personalInfo.name, title: personalInfo.title })}
      ${About({ text: personalInfo.about })}
      ${Skills({ skills: personalInfo.skills })}
      ${Content({ games: personalInfo.games })}
      ${Footer({ name: personalInfo.name, year: personalInfo.year })}
    </div>
  `
}

// Example of a Content component for favorite games
function Content(props) {
  // Using the games array passed as a prop
  const gamesList = props.games
    .map(
      (game) =>
        `<article class="game-card">
      <h3>${game.title}</h3>
      <img src="${game.imageUrl}" alt="${game.title} cover image">
      <p><strong>Genre:</strong> ${game.genre}</p>
      <p>${game.description}</p>
    </article>`,
    )
    .join('')

  return `
    <section id="favorite-games">
      <h2>My Favorite Games</h2>
      <div class="games-container">
        ${gamesList}
      </div>
    </section>
  `
}

// Rendering to the DOM
document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = App()
```
