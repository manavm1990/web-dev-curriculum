## Assignment: Reflection (10 points)

This one is fairly open, but do write enough to convince me that you did the reading and have put some thought into it. As always, your own personal analogies and examples are encouraged.

What did you learn? What did you already know? What surprised you? What other questions do you have?

## Extra Credit (5 points)

You could write the above reflection as a regular, boring old mere mortal document. Or...you could write it like a developer by creating a new repository, initializing it with a README.md, and writing your reflection in Markdown. You could even add some emojis, headers, and links, etc.

If you want to go the dev route, it's worth 5 extra points.
