# Markdown

Most of these curriculum is being written in Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## HTML vs Markdown

### HTML

You're already familiar with HTML. It's a markup language. The purpose of HTML is to 'mark up' various pieces of text with angle brackets and various tags to distinguish their roles.

<Large>The role of HTML is not to style things. Unfortunately, many people do things such as use `<br>` tags to create space between elements instead of CSS üíÑ margins and padding. Or, folks even misuse heading tags to 'make things bigger'. üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Keep in mind the roles of HTML and CSS üíÑ as part of the the Holy Trinity of Web Development.</Large>

HTML is specifically written to be rendered in a web browser. Opening an HTML file in a text editor will only show you the raw code.

### Markdown

Markdown, like HTML is also a markup language. However, Markdown can be rendered in VS Code, GitHub and many other places. In fact, a web browser by itself can't render Markdown. It needs to be converted to HTML first.

Markdown features many fewer tags than HTML, so it's much simpler. It's also easier to read in its raw form.

Generally, styling is handled by the Markdown engine, so the writer doesn't have to worry about it. This is why you'll see a lot of Markdown files with very little styling.

## Why Markdown, Precisely?

Markdown is a great way to write content that will be rendered in multiple places. For example, this curriculum is written in Markdown, but it's rendered in a web browser, in VS Code, and in GitHub.

The most immediate use of Markdown pertains to README files. When you create a new project on GitHub, you'll be prompted to create a `README.md` file. That `.md` indicates a Markdown file. This file will be rendered on the front page of your repository. It's a great way to introduce your project to the world.

Beyond this, much documentation is written in Markdown and even supersets of Markdown such as MDX. However, in this course, we will stick with the basics of just Markdown.

Specifically, we'll focus on GitHub flavored Markdown, which enhances basic Markdown.

If you are interested in seeing the MDX source code for this entire curriculum, you can click the 'View Source' üîó in the footer üëáüèæ. However, note that this is using MDX and not just MD, so what we are learning here doesn't cover what you see in the source.

  It's actually not uncommon to use Markdown for things, but then to mix in some HTML right in the
  same file. This is because Markdown is a subset of HTML, so you can mix and match. That is, HTML
  can go into Markdown, but not the other way around.

## Markdown in VS Code

In the following video, we'll create a new directory and practice writing Markdown in VS Code. We'll also see how Markdown is rendered in VS Code.

Relevant Shortcuts:

- `Cmd + Shift + V` - Open Command Palette
- `Cmd + K, V` - Open Preview to the Side
- `Cmd + B` - Toggle Sidebar
- `Cmd + \` - Split Editor

For Windows users, replace `Cmd` with `Ctrl`.

Remember that the 'ultimate shortcut' is to use the Command Palette. You can access it by pressing `Cmd + Shift + P` on a Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows.

## Assignment - 30 points

### GitHub Markdown Tutorial - 20 points

<Large>
  Your deliverable is going to be a `README.md` file in a GitHub repository. This file should
  contain a variety of Markdown content, basically everything that's shown in this [this GitHub
  Markdown tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
</Large>

Note that to receive full credit, you must make all of the shown examples your own. Don't just copy/paste what they have, but take this opportunity to include content that's relevant and unique to you.

That also makes it more interesting and fun for me to grade! ;)

This video will refresh you on setting up the Git repository and connecting it to GitHub with `gh repo create`.
