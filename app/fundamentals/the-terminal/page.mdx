# The Terminal

In your development process, you'll undoubtedly be required to run some commands in the terminal (or on the "command line" — these are effectively the same thing). This article provides an introduction to the terminal, the essential commands you'll need to enter into it, how to chain commands together, and how to add your own command line interface (CLI) tools.

## Welcome to the terminal

The terminal is a text interface for executing text-based programs. Much web development tooling usually requires that you'll have to pop open the command line and run some commands. This is because many tools are designed to be run from the command line, and it's often the quickest and most efficient way to interact with them.

A large number of tools can be used by typing commands into the command line; many come pre-installed on your system, and a huge number of others are installable from package registries.

One of the biggest criticisms of the command line is that it lacks hugely in user experience. Viewing the command line for the first time can be a daunting experience: a blank screen and a blinking cursor, with very little obvious help available on what to do.

On the surface, they're far from welcoming but there's a lot you can do with them! The command line is a powerful tool that can help you be more productive and efficient in your work.

## The terminal prompt

When you open a terminal (Warp on Mac, GitBash on Windows), you'll see a prompt. This is where you type your commands. The prompt usually shows some information about your current location in the file system, and sometimes other information like the current time, the user you're logged in as, and the name of the computer you're using.

## Basic built-in terminal commands

Here are some basic terminal commands that you can use to navigate around your file system:

- `ls` — list the contents of the current directory.
- `cd` — change directory. For example, `cd my-folder` will move you into the `my-folder` directory.
- `pwd` — print working directory. This will show you the full path of the directory you're currently in.
- `mkdir` — make directory. For example, `mkdir my-folder` will create a new directory called `my-folder`.
- `touch` — create a new file. For example, `touch index.html` will create a new file called `index.html`.
- `cat` — view the contents of a file. For example, `cat index.html` will show you the contents of the `index.html` file, provided that it exists.

## Creating a Project Structure

Let's see how these commands work together to create a project:

<Mermaid
  chart={`graph TD
    A[Home Directory] -->|cd Dev| B[Dev Directory]
    B -->|mkdir first-website| C[first-website Created]
    C -->|cd first-website| D[Inside first-website]
    D -->|touch index.html| E[index.html Created]
    D -->|touch styles.css| F[styles.css Created]
    D -->|mkdir images| G[images/ Created]
    
    H[How to go back] -->|cd ..| I[Goes up one level]
    H -->|cd ~| J[Goes to Home]
    
    style A fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style B fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style C fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style D fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style E fill:#818cf8,stroke:#4f46e5
    style F fill:#818cf8,stroke:#4f46e5
    style G fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style H fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5,stroke-width:2
    style I fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5
    style J fill:#c7d2fe,stroke:#4f46e5`}
/>

Watch and follow along with these 3️⃣ videos in order to create a project structure:

<div className="md:flex gap-4 [&_figcaption]:text-center">
<figure>
  <YouTubeEmbed videoid="UnPvIENeMF8" width={400} params="controls=0" />
  <figcaption>1</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <YouTubeEmbed videoid="B3Z7hfV2pJw" width={400} params="controls=0" />
  <figcaption>2</figcaption>

<figure>
  <YouTubeEmbed videoid="wnbpfgKYvQ4" width={400} params="controls=0" />
  <figcaption>3</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

You can chain commands together using the `&&` operator. This allows you to run multiple commands in sequence. For example, `cd my-folder && ls` will move you into the `my-folder` directory and then list the contents of that directory.

### Optional for Warp Users (Mac)

Recall that <Link href="dev-xp-tools/mac#install-autojump">you installed the Oh My Zsh plugin called autojump.</Link> This allows you to quickly navigate to directories that you have visited before. For example, if you have visited the `Dev` directory before, you can type `j Dev` to quickly jump to that directory.

## A slightly more complex example

Here's a slightly more complex example of chaining commands together. This command will create a new directory called `my-folder`, move into that directory, create a new file called `index.html`, and then list the contents of the directory:

`mkdir my-folder && cd my-folder && touch index.html && ls`

We could have replicated all that you saw in the videos ☝️ with: `mkdir Dev && cd Dev && mkdir SWIC && cd SWIC && mkdir throwaway && cd throwaway && touch index.html && touch styles.css && mkdir images`. Go nuts!

## Terminal Practice Exercise - 20 points

Create the following project structure in your Dev folder:

```shell
my-portfolio/
├── index.html
├── styles/
│ ├── main.css
│ └── reset.css
├── images/
│ └── profile/
└── scripts/
└── main.js
```

Steps:

1. Navigate to your Dev folder
2. Create the project folder
3. Create all necessary directories
4. Create all necessary files
5. Use `ls` to verify your structure
6. Practice moving between directories using `cd`

### Optional Extra Challenge (5 extra credit points):

You can use AI or otherwise research the commands mentioned and try these out:

- Create a backup of your `index.html` file using `cp`
- Rename main.css to style.css using `mv`

## Deliverables

- A screenshot of your project structure in the terminal
- A screenshot of your `history` showing the commands that you used to create the project structure. You could use your mouse to highlight the commands that you used. Or, you could just create a quick video. No voice or face necessary, just show the work you did in the terminal.
- A few sentences reflecting on your experience with the terminal. What did you find easy? What did you find challenging? Do you have any tips for others who are new to the terminal**?**
