# How Computers Work

People often think of computers as complex machines, but at their core, they are built on simple principles. Understanding how computers work can help you appreciate the technology that powers our daily lives.

We often hear things about 0s and 1s, or binary. But what does that mean?

The following video from none other than Todd McLeod explains the concept of binary in a fun and engaging way.

Note that the video mentions the Go programming language, but the concepts are universal. And, yes, Go is a fantastic language, not sure that it's the 'best programming language' as Todd suggests, but it is a great one.

Without further ado, here is the video:

## Assignment: Reflection (10 points)

This one is a freeform. Just write down say, 3-5 things that you got out of the video. More importantly, how do you think this will help you in your journey to becoming a web developer?

I'm interested in how well you related to Todd's presentation and approach. What stuck out to you? Did it connect with anything that you've learned before? Did it make you think differently about computers?

Let me know what you think in a short paragraph or two.
