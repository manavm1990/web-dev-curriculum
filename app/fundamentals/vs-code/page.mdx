# VS Code

VS Code at its base is nothing but a text editor with minimal differences from other text editors such as Notepad, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc. However, it has emerged to become one of the most popular code editors in the world. This is due to its extensibility, customizability, and ease of use.

We'll get started with the very basics of VS Code and get acquainted with its baseline features. Then, we'll selectively customize it with a "...particular set of ~~skills~~ extensions" to make it a powerful tool for web development, specifically JS.

## Overview

These two videos will give an overview of what we need to know about VS Code:

## Shortcuts

<Large>
  Throughout the course, keep in mind that generally the shortcuts for Mac will be `Cmd` and for
  Windows it will be `Ctrl`.
</Large>

Learning some of the most common shortcuts will help you navigate VS Code more efficiently. Here are some of the most useful ones:

- `Ctrl + P`: Quick Open. It's a fuzzy file finder. You can type the name of a file and it will show you a list of matching files in your project. For Mac, it's `Cmd + P`.
- `Ctrl + Shift + P`: Command Palette. It allows you to access all of VS Code's commands. For Mac, it's `Cmd + Shift + P`.
- `Ctrl + B`: Toggle Sidebar. It shows or hides the sidebar. For Mac, it's `Cmd + B`.

## Extensions and Themes

The following video shows the use of `Cmd + Shift + X` to access the extensions panel. You can search for the extensions by name and install them.

<Large>
  Please do not install extensions beyond what we are using for this course unless you have prior
  experience with them.

## Must Have Extensions

We won't cover what these are doing, but that will become apparent as we use them throughout the course. Simply search for them in the extensions panel and install them.

- Prettier - Automatically formats your code to follow consistent style rules
- ESLint - Catches common programming errors and enforces coding standards
- Error Lens - Shows errors and warnings directly in your code as you type
- Conventional Commits - Helps write standardized commit messages
- Better Comments - Makes code comments more readable with color-coding
- Code Spell Checker - Catches typos in your code and comments
- GitHub Markdown Preview - Shows how your markdown will look on GitHub
- HTML Hint - Highlights HTML errors and suggests fixes
- Live Share - Lets you code together with others in real-time
- Markdown Checkboxes - Adds interactive checkboxes to markdown files
- Markdown Preview GitHub Styling - Makes markdown look like GitHub's style
- Material Icon Theme - Adds helpful icons to different file types
- Sort Lines - Helps organize lists and imports alphabetically
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense - Provides autocomplete for Tailwind classes

## Further Customization of VS Code

The official VS Code Blog has [an article](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/06/20/great-looking-editor-roundup) to guide you through customizing themes, icons, and settings.

## AI ðŸ¤–

Although it's not compulsory to leverage AI tools, they can be a great help in your coding journey. Many developers are '10x-ing,' as the phrase goes, their productivity with the help of AI.

This course does cover some assignments that typically would not be feasible for new programmers to complete without the help of AI.

It's 2025. AI is the wave of the future, so might as well get used to it now.

## AI and Learning

When using AI tools for learning:

- Ask AI to explain concepts and break down code step-by-step
- Use it to check your understanding by explaining code back to it
- Ask "why" questions about code it generates
- Practice writing code yourself first, then use AI to improve it
- Break large problems into smaller pieces and solve them incrementally

### AI and Grading

A powerful weapon in the hands of someone without experience can be dangerous. It's referred to as a footgun.

Simply put:

<Large>Do not blindly copy/paste code that you don't understand at least 80% of.</Large>

You will not learn anything and you will be at a disadvantage in the long run.

In fact, some of the assignments given in this course are deliberately designed to trick AI into giving irrelevant code that's not connected to the lesson materials. If you use code that is completely irrelevant to the lesson, you will not receive credit for the assignment.

This is also why we will be using video submissions along with reflection documents. Therein, you will explain your thought process and how you arrived at the solution, including walking through your AI prompts and the code you received. These submissions will always carry more weight than the finished code itself.

### Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that suggests code snippets and entire functions as you type. It can be a great productivity booster, but it's important to use it responsibly and not rely on it too heavily.

Please follow [this setup guide from VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup). The free plan allows you to use Copilot for 60 minutes per day.

In addition, as a student you can [get numerous benefits from GitHub Student Developer Pack,](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student) including a free subscription to GitHub Copilot.

### Claude Sonnet (Optional)

Claude is arguably the best AI coding assistant available. It's only worth it if you pay for [Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), and of course it can be used for more than just coding.

And, if you do pay for it, get the desktop app. On Mac just do: `brew install --cask claude`. For Windows, [download the installer.](https://claude.ai/download)

## Assignment - 10 points

### Screenshots

1. Send screenshot of any/all code that you write in VS Code.
1. Send screenshot of your installed extensions, confirming that you did install <Link href='/fundamentals/vs-code#must-have-extensions'>the extensions listed above.</Link>

### Reflection

You can mention your experience with VS Code, but most importantly this reflection is about you and AI.

- What are your thoughts on AI and coding?
- What are your thoughts on AI and learning in general?
- How much have you used AI in the past? Don't worry, it's safe place. I won't snitch to your other instructors! ;)

It's the future and it's fascinating, so really anything else you want to share or even if you want to record a video, feel free to do so!
