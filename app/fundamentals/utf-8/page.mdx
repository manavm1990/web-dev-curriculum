# UTF-8

Previously, we got to know about how computers in general can communicate various messages using binary.

Back in the day, folks used to work with punch cards, which were physical cards with holes punched in them. Each hole or absence of a hole represented a different piece of information. This was a way to encode data in a format that machines could understand.

Fast forward and of course now we write code using text, including words, numbers, and symbols. But how does a computer understand this text? That's where character encoding comes in.

Character encoding is a system that pairs each character with a specific number. This allows computers to store and manipulate text. The most common character encoding system is UTF-8., which stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit." UTF-8 is a way to encode characters so that they can be represented in binary. It can represent every character in the Unicode standard, which includes characters from many different languages and symbol sets.

In other words, UTF-8 is critical to bride the gap between understandable human text and the binary language of computers.

In the following video, Tom Scott AKA Computerphile explains how UTF-8 works. He does a great job of breaking down the concept in a way that's easy to understand.

**Fun Fact:** Even the Klingon language from Star Trek is included in the Unicode standard! üññüèæ
