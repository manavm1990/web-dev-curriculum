# UTF-8

Previously, we got to know about how computers in general can communicate various messages using binary.

Back in the day, folks used to work with punch cards, which were physical cards with holes punched in them. Each hole or absence of a hole represented a different piece of information. This was a way to encode data in a format that machines could understand.

Fast forward and of course now we write code using text, including words, numbers, and symbols. But how does a computer understand this text? That's where character encoding comes in.

Character encoding is a system that pairs each character with a specific number. This allows computers to store and manipulate text. The most common character encoding system is UTF-8., which stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit." UTF-8 is a way to encode characters so that they can be represented in binary. It can represent every character in the Unicode standard, which includes characters from many different languages and symbol sets.

In other words, UTF-8 is critical to bride the gap between understandable human text and the binary language of computers.

In the following video, Tom Scott AKA Computerphile explains how UTF-8 works. He does a great job of breaking down the concept in a way that's easy to understand.

## Assignment: Reflection (10 points)

This one is a freeform. Just write down say, 3-5 things that you got out of the video. More importantly, how do you think this will help you in your journey to becoming a web developer?

Did this connect with anything that you've learned before? Did it make you think differently about computers?

Let me know what you think in a short paragraph or two.
