# Soft skills

## Introduction

Soft skills can mean a lot of different things in different contexts. Here, we are referring to the skill of learning to learn. This is a skill that is often overlooked in traditional education, but it is one of the most important skills you can develop as a student. The ability to learn new things quickly and effectively is a skill that will serve you well in any career you choose.

## Constant Learning Mindset

'Constant learning?!' That sounds exhausting! But it doesn't have to be. The key is to make learning a habit. Just like brushing your teeth or going to the gym, learning is something you can do every day. And just like brushing your teeth or going to the gym, the more you do it, the easier it gets.

The web is constantly evolving and technologies and trends are always changing, and they need to constantly update their knowledge to keep up. This is why it is important to develop a constant learning mindset. This means that you are always looking for new things to learn and ways to improve your skills.

- Get into the habit of regularly reading technical news and blogs. We'll mention a few as we go through the course. And, as you find your own, share with the class.
- Engage in reading tasks or small research projects semi-regularly. Well, for now you can just read this curriculum.
- Set aside specific learning time to spend on acquiring new skills. This is partly why we have two assignments due each week. I want to discourage cramming and encourage regular learning. Going for 20-60 minutes per day for working on the materials in this class is much more effective than just cramming for 3 hours the night before an assignment is due. Again, like going to the gym. We go regularly and make it a habit. We don't go once per week and spend 3 hours there.
- Be curious. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you don't understand something, ask for help. This is a safe space to ask questions. I'm here to help you learn.

## Open to Embracing Failure

Here, failure doesn't mean failing the class, but be aware that some weeks are going to be more challenging than others. You're not going to necessarily ace every week.

A very common issue that causes students and new developers to shy away from experimentation and taking risks (for example when starting new projects or exploring new ideas) is fear of failure. Spend some time learning about the value that can be gleaned from making mistakes, and the lessons that can be learned and applied in the future in similar situations.

- Again, this class is meant to be a safe space to ask questions. Use our Teams channel to ask questions. If you're struggling with something, chances are someone else is too.
- AI is your friend. [Claude Sonnet (with the Pro Subscription)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet) is really great for helping you write code. It's not perfect, but it can help you get started on a problem. Just remember to understand the code you're writing. Don't just blindly copy and paste.

As far as grading, almost every assignment will ask you to submit either a written reflection and/or a 'code walkthrough.' These will actually count for more points than the actual code you write. In other words, effort is going to be rewarded. If you're struggling with a problem, write about it. What did you try? What didn't work? What did you learn from it? This is a great way to show that you're learning and growing as a developer and maintain a decent grade in the class.

## Effective Research

The first place to check for answers will be the [MDN Web Docs.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) They even have an AI tool to help you drill down to the correct information. This requires an MDN+, which is $5 per month and goes to support the MDN Web Docs. I highly recommend it.

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) can be useful, but be careful. It's a great place to find answers, but it's also a great place to find bad advice. Always double-check the answers you find there. Perhaps verify it with Claude Sonnet.

With traditional Googling, check the dates on articles, and consider whether the techniques discussed are out-of-date. For example, does an article on CSS layout talk about modern approaches like grid and flexbox, or does it still present obsolete techniques like multi-column layouts with floats? Does it still talk about hacks for ancient browsers like Internet Explorer or Netscape 4?

When you find a useful answer, write about it. For example, blog about it or share it on a social network. Not only will the process of writing clarify the concepts to you, but you'll also get validation and/or feedback from the community. It could also help you to start making a name for yourself in the industry. [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) is a great place to start.

### Asking Good Questions

When you ask a question, be specific. Don't just say, "My code doesn't work." Say, "I'm trying to do X, but when I do Y, Z happens. I've tried A, B, and C, but it's still not working. Can you help me understand what's going on?"

Also, show what you've tried. If you're asking for help with a piece of code, show the code. If you're asking for help with a concept, show what you've read or what you've tried.

Finally, be polite. Remember, you're asking for help. People are taking time out of their day to help you. Be respectful of their time and effort.

## Conclusion

Developing soft skills is just as important as developing technical skills. In fact, many employers value soft skills more than technical skills. By developing a constant learning mindset, being open to embracing failure, and learning how to effectively research and ask good questions, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful web developer. Remember, the journey of learning is continuous, and the skills you develop here will serve you throughout your career.
